# Controls

There are a lot of controls in EmuVR, and each core also supports control mapping via RetroArch. It is important to note that this document covers controls used mainly by EmuVR and **NOT** RetroArch, as those can be mapped by running RetroArch.exe or using the RetroArch menu while running a game.

At this time you can play using Keyboard/Mouse, Vive Wands, Oculus Touch, or gamepads that support XInput/can emulate XInput via software.


This list is incomplete- a ? represents a control that has not yet been confirmed/documented.
